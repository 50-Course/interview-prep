Prefix and Suffix algorithms are useful techniques when working with 
computations in an array or a numbered sequence. They are used to calculate the sum of elements

Prefix Sum:
Given an array of integers, the prefix sum of the array is an array of the same length
where the ith element is the sum of the first i+1 elements of the original array.

Suffix Sum:
Given an array of integers, the suffix sum of the array is an array of the same length
where the ith element is the sum of the last n-i elements of the original array.
